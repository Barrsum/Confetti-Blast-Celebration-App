## Overview

This project is a simple yet engaging web app designed to provide a satisfying visual and auditory celebration effect. Clicking the central "Celebrate!" button triggers:

*   A vibrant burst of confetti originating from the button's center, using the `canvas-confetti` library.
*   A series of CSS-animated fireworks launching from the bottom of the screen.
*   A cheerful celebration sound effect.

The application also includes:

*   **Theme Toggling:** Switch between dark and light modes using a dedicated button. The UI adapts using CSS custom properties.
*   **Mute Functionality:** A mute button allows users to toggle the celebration sound on or off.
*   **Fixed Layout:** The header and footer remain fixed, while the main content area is centered vertically and horizontally with no page scrolling.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts cleanly to different screen sizes, adjusting button positions and header text alignment on mobile.

This project was developed as Day [4](Link) of the **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge (April 2025), leveraging AI assistance for brainstorming, code generation, debugging, and refinement, following the principles of **#VibeCoding**.

## Features

*   **Interactive Celebration Button:** The core trigger for all effects.
*   **Circular Confetti Burst:** Uses `canvas-confetti` for a dynamic, multi-shot confetti explosion centered on the button.
*   **CSS-Based Fireworks Animation:** Custom CSS keyframe animations create a launching and bursting firework effect.
*   **Audio Feedback:** Plays an `.mp3` sound effect upon celebration (can be muted).
*   **Mute Toggle:** Button using `react-icons` to enable/disable the celebration sound.
*   **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** Easily switch UI themes using CSS Variables.
*   **Fixed Header & Footer:** Provides consistent framing for the application. Includes project title in the header and social links (`react-icons`) in the footer.
*   **No-Scroll Responsive Layout:** Content is centered within the viewport using Flexbox, ensuring a clean look without scrolling on any device size.
*   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React, Vite, and modern CSS.
*   **AI-Assisted Development:** Utilized AI tools throughout the development process as part of the #VibeCoding challenge.
